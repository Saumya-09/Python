### Deploying to Herokuapp.com
Sign Up for a Heroku Account

To deploy an app on Heroku, you need an account on the platform. It is quick and easy  to sign up.

After you are logged in to your Heroku account, you will find yourself in the Heroku Dashboard. It says, “Getting Started with Heroku”. If you are new to Heroku, select one of the icons that represent your programming language and follow the Getting Started guide to create a new app.

But Heroku offers a way for you to get started even quicker by using a tool called Buttons. With just the click of a button, you can deploy a preconfigured app that has everything it needs, including code, configurations, and add-ons. By creating your first Heroku app with a button, you get a flavor for how easy the platform is to use.
Install your first app by clicking this button:

Enter a name for your new app, or let Heroku choose one for you.
Select in which region to create your runtime: the United States or Europe.
Click Create App to deploy the application. Within a minute or two, your app will be up and running on Heroku!
