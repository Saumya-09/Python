### Python History
- Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.
- The implementation of Python was started in the December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherland.
- In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.
- In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like: lambda, map, filter, and reduce.
- Python 2.0 added new features like: list comprehensions, garbage collection system.
- On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify fundamental flaw of the language.
- ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with Amoeba Operating System.
- Python is influenced by following programming languages:
- ABC language.
- Python programming language is being updated regularly with new features and supports. There are lots of updations in python versions, started from 1994 to current release.

#### A simple python code

------------

> ###### Python program to add two numbers :

> num1 = 15
num2 = 12 
> sum = num1 + num2  
> print("Sum of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(num1, num2, sum)) 

> ###### Output:
> Sum of 15 and 12 is 27


# Features of Python and its importance 

Designed by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum in 1989, Python is a general-purpose dynamic programming language with an emphasis on readability. One of the reasons why it is become such a popular programming language is its beginner-friendly code. While other languages contain complex syntax that is comparable to reading to a foreign language, Python is the exact opposite: the code is simple enough so that just about anyone can understand it, regardless of their experience with the language. If you are interested in learning more about Python, check out some of its key features listed below.

##### 1. Open Source
------------
Like PHP, Rust, Swift and Perl, Python is an open-source software, meaning its source code is available within the license, and users are allowed to access, modify and/or distribute to the code to anyone without the developers permission.

##### 2. Portable

------------
Because it is an open-source software, Python has been ported to run on a variety of different platforms, some of which include Windows, Mac, Solaris, OS/2, BeOS, PlayStation, Sharp Zarus, Windows CE, PocketPC and more.

##### 3. Object-Oriented and Procedure-Oriented

------------


Python supports both procedure-oriented and object-oriented functions. Procedure-oriented means the language is designed around procedures and functions that are reused throughout the language. In comparison, object-oriented means the language is built around objects that combine data and functionality.

##### 4. Embeddable

------------


Python is embeddable with C or C++ programming, allowing users to enhance their code with scripting functions.

##### 5. Easy to Learn

------------


As we mentioned earlier, Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that is easy to learn, regardless of your experience/knowledge with the language.

##### 6. Libraries

------------


One of Pythons greatest strengths is its libraries. The standard library contains tools to assist programmers in using the language, supporting many formats and protocols like MIME and HTTP. Also included in Python’s standard library is modules for creating graphical user interfaces, modules for manipulating regular expressions, and modules for unit testing.


### Limitations or Disadvantages of Python

#### 1. Difficulty in Using Other Languages

------------


The Python lovers become so accustomed to its features and its extensive libraries, so they face problem in learning or working on other programming languages. Python experts may see the declaring of cast “values” or variable “types”, syntactic requirements of adding curly braces or semi colons as an onerous task.
#### 2. Weak in Mobile Computing

------------


Python has made its presence on many desktop and server platforms, but it is seen as a weak language for mobile computing. This is the reason very few mobile applications are built in it like Carbonnelle.
#### 3. Gets Slow in Speed

------------


Python executes with the help of an interpreter instead of the compiler, which causes it to slow down because compilation and execution help it to work normally. On the other hand, it can be seen that it is fast for many web applications too.
#### 4. Run-time Errors

------------


The Python language is dynamically typed so it has many design restrictions that are reported by some Python developers. It is even seen that it requires more testing time, and the errors show up when the applications are finally run.

# Implementations of Python
#### Cpython

------------


The default implementation of the Python programming language is Cpython. As the name suggests Cpython is written in C language. Cpython compiles the python source code into intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the Cpython virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and Python. CPython provides the highest level of compatibility with Python packages and C extension modules. All versions of the Python language are implemented in C because CPython is the reference implementation.
#### Jython

------------


Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language that can run on the Java platform. Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules .Jython compiles into Java byte code, which can then be run by Java virtual machine. Jython enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program. Jython is slow as compared to Cpython and lacks compatibility with CPython libraries.

#### IronPython

------------


A Python implementation written in C# targeting Microsofts .NET framework. Similar to Jython, it uses .Net Virtual Machine i.e Common Language Runtime. IronPython can use the .NET Framework and Python libraries, and other .NET languages can use Python code very efficiently. IronPython performs better in Python programs that use threads or multiple cores, as it has a JIT, and also because it doesnt have the Global Interpreter Lock.
#### PyPy

------------


“If you want your code to run faster, you should probably just use PyPy.” — Guido van Rossum (creator of Python)
Python is dynamic programming language. Python is said to be slow as the default CPython implementation compiles the python source code in bytecode which is slow as compared to machine code(native code). Here PyPy comes in.
PyPy is an implementation of the Python programming language written in Python. The Interpreter is written in RPython (a subset of Python).

# Build process in Python
Python first compiles your source code (.py file) into a format known as byte code . Compilation is simply a translation step, and byte code is a lower-level, and platform-independent, representation of your source code. Compiled code is usually stored in .pyc files , and is regenerated when the source is updated, or when otherwise necessary.

The bytecode (.pyc file) is loaded into the Python runtime and interpreted by a Python Virtual Machine , which is a piece of code that reads each instruction in the bytecode and executes whatever operation is indicated. Byte code compilation is automatic, and the PVM is just part of the Python system that you have installed on your machine. The PVM is always present as part of the Python system , and is the component that truly runs your scripts. Technically, it's just the last step of what is called the Python interpreter. And this is how the process is done. Of course, there are optimizations and caches to improve the performance.

Each time an interpreted program is run, the interpreter must convert source code into machine code and also pull in the runtime libraries . This conversion process makes the program run slower than a comparable program written in a compiled language. Python do something clever to improve its performance . It compiles to bytecode (.pyc files) the first time it executes a file. This improves substantially the execution of the code next time the module is imported or executed.
