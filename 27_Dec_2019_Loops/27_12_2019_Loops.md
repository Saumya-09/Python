# Loops in Python

[![](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/Python-Loops-01.jpg)](http://https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/Python-Loops-01.jpg)

#### Introduction to Python Loop
When you want some statements to execute a hundred times, you don’t repeat them 100 times. Think of when you want to print numbers 1 to 99. Or that you want to say Hello to 99 friends. In such a case, you can use loops in python.

Here, we have 4 types of Python Loop:

- Python For Loop
- Python While Loop
- Python Loop Control Statements
- Nested For Loop in Python


#### Python While loop:

[![](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/while-loops-in-Python-300x300.jpg)](http://https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/while-loops-in-Python-300x300.jpg)

When the program control reaches the while loop, the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the block of code under it is executed. Remember to indent all statements under the loop equally. After that, the condition is checked again. This continues until the condition becomes false. Then, the first statement, if any, after the loop is executed.

```python
a=3
while(a>0):
	print(a)
       a-=1
Output:
3
2
1
```
This loop prints numbers from 3 to 1.

** a. An Infinite Loop **
Be careful while using a while loop. Because if you forget to increment the counter variable in python, or write flawed logic, the condition may never become false. In such a case, the loop will run infinitely, and the conditions after the loop will starve. To stop execution, press Ctrl+C. However, an infinite loop may actually be useful. This in cases when a semaphore is needed, or for client/server programming. A semaphore is a variable used solely for synchronization in accessing shared resources.

** b. The else statement for while loop **
A while loop may have an else statement after it. When the condition becomes false, the block under the else statement is executed. However, it doesn’t execute if you break out of the loop or if an exception is raised.

```python
a=3
	while(a>0):
		print(a)
		a-=1
else:
    print("Reached 0")
Outout:
3
2
1
```

In the following code, we put a break statement in the body of the while loop for a==1. So, when that happens, the statement in the else block is not executed.

```python
a=3
while(a>0):
	print(a)
	a-=1
	if a==1: 
		break;
	else:
		print("Reached 0")
Output:
3
2
```
#### Python for loop:

[![](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/for-loops-in-Python-300x300.jpg)](http://https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/for-loops-in-Python-300x300.jpg)

Python for loop can iterate over a sequence of items. The structure of a for loop in Python is different than that in C++ or Java. That is, for(int i=0;i< n ; i++) wont work here. In Python, we use the ‘in’ keyword. 

```python
for a in range(3):
	print(a+1)
Outout:
1
2
3
```
** a. The range() function **
This function yields a sequence of numbers. When called with one argument, say n, it creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1.

```python
list(range(10))
Output:
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

```


```python
list(range(2,7))
Output:
	[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
```python
list(range(2,12,2))
Output:
	[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
**Remember, the interval can also be negative.**

**b. Iterating on lists or similar constructs**
You aren’t bound to use the range() function, though. You can use the loop to iterate on a list or a similar construct.

```python
for a in [1,2,3]:
	print(a)
Output:
1
2
3
```
You can also iterate on a string.

```python
for i in 'wisdom':
	print(i)
Output:
w
i
s
d
o
m
```
#### Nested for Loops Python

You can also nest a loop inside another. You can put a for loop inside a while, or a while inside a for, or a for inside a for, or a while inside a while. Or you can put a loop inside a loop inside a loop. You can go as far as you want.

```python
>>> i=6
>>> while(i>0):
        j=6
        while(j>i):
            print("*",end=' ')
            j-=1
        i-=1
        print()
Output:
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```
# Loop control Statements:

[![](https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/Loop-Control-Statements_Mesa-de-trabajo-1.jpg)](http://https://d2h0cx97tjks2p.cloudfront.net/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/Loop-Control-Statements_Mesa-de-trabajo-1.jpg)

**a. break statement**
When you put a break statement in the body of a loop, the loop stops executing, and control shifts to the first statement outside it. You can put it in a for or while loop.

```python
for i in 'break':
	print(i)
		if i=='a': break;
Output:
b
r
e
a
```
**b. continue statement**
When the program control reaches the continue statement, it skips the statements after ‘continue’. It then shifts to the next item in the sequence and executes the block of code for it. You can use it with both for and while loops.

```python
i=0
while(i<8):
	i+=1
	if(i==6): continue
	print(i)
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
7
8
```
**c. pass statement**
In Python, we use the pass statement to implement stubs. When we need a particular loop, class, or function in our program, but do not know what goes in it, we place the pass statement in it. It is a null statement. The interpreter does not ignore it, but it performs a no-operation (NOP).

```python
for i in 'selfhelp':
	pass
	print(i)
Output:
p
```
# Conditions (if,elif,else) in Python:

[![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/nested-if.jpg)](http://https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/nested-if.jpg)

#### What are if...else statement in Python?
Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.

The if…elif…else statement is used in Python for decision making.

Python if Statement Syntax:

> if test expression:
>	statement(s)

Here, the program evaluates the test expression and will execute statement(s) only if the text expression is True.

If the text expression is False, the statement(s) is not executed.
In Python, the body of the if statement is indicated by the indentation. Body starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.
Python interprets non-zero values as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False.

Example:
```python
num = 3
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number.")
print("This is always printed.")

num = -1
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number.")
print("This is also always printed.")

Output:
3 is a positive number
This is always printed
This is also always printed.
```

#### Python if...else Statement

------------


Syntax of if...else
>if test expression:
>   Body of if
>else:
>   Body of else

The if..else statement evaluates test expression and will execute body of if only when test condition is True.
If the condition is False, body of else is executed. Indentation is used to separate the blocks.

Example:
```python
num = 3
if num >= 0:
    print("Positive or Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")

Output:
	Positive or Zero
```
#### Python if...elif...else Statement

------------


Syntax of if...elif...else
>if test expression:
>    Body of if
>elif test expression:
>    Body of elif
>else: 
>    Body of else

The elif is short for else if. It allows us to check for multiple expressions.
If the condition for if is False, it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on.
If all the conditions are False, body of else is executed.
Only one block among the several if...elif...else blocks is executed according to the condition.
The if block can have only one else block. But it can have multiple elif blocks.

Example:
```python
num = 3.4
if num > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif num == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")
	Output:
	Positive number
```
#### Python Nested if statements

------------


We can have a if...elif...else statement inside another if...elif...else statement. This is called nesting in computer programming.

Any number of these statements can be nested inside one another. Indentation is the only way to figure out the level of nesting. This can get confusing, so must be avoided if we can.

Examples:
```python
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
if num >= 0:
    if num == 0:
        print("Zero")
    else:
        print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")

Output:
Enter a number: 5
Positive number
```
# Modules in Python

Python Language Modules
1) What is Python Module?
2) Purpose of Modules
3) Types of Modules
4) How to use Modules
5) User defined Modules in Python

####  What is Python Module?
 	A module is a file consisting of Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code. Any Python file can be referenced as a module.

	A file containing Python code, for example: test.py, is called a module, and its name would be test..

#### Module vs. Function

Function: it’s a block of code that you can use/reuse by calling it with a keyword. Eg. print() is a function.

Module: it’s a .py file that contains a list of functions (it can also contain variables and classes). Eg. in statistics.mean(a), mean is a function that is found in the statistics module.

#### Purpose of Modules
	As our program grows more in the size we may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance as well as re-usability of the code. The solution to this is Modules.

	We can define your most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs. A module can be imported by another program to make use of its functionality. This is how you can use the Python standard library as well.

#### Types of Modules
	 Python provides us with some built-in modules, which can be imported by using the “import” keyword.

	 Python also allows us to create your own modules and use them in your programs.

#### How to use Modules
Built-in modules are written in C and integrated with the Python interpreter.

Each built-in module contains resources for certain system-specific functionalities such as OS management, disk IO, etc.

> help(‘modules’)

[![List of modules](https://www.edureka.co/blog/content/ver.1556540029/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-10-17_16_33-Window.png "List of modules")](http://https://www.edureka.co/blog/content/ver.1556540029/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-10-17_16_33-Window.png "List of modules")

There is a Python Standard Library with dozens of built-in modules. From those, five important modules,
random, statistics, math, datetime, csv

**Python math module,**

This contains factorial, power, and logarithmic functions, but also some trigonometry and constants.

##### i) import math

And then:

```python
math.factorial(5)
math.pi
math.sqrt(5)
math.log(256, 2)
```

##### ii) import math as m

```python
m.factorial(5)
m.pi
m.sqrt(5)
m.log(256, 2)
```

##### iii) from math import factorial

Here, we first call the from keyword, then math for the module. Next, we use the import keyword and call the specific function we would like to use.

```python
print (factorial(5))
```

##### iv) from math import *

```python
print(factorial(5))
print(pi)
print(sqrt(5)
print(log(256, 2))
```

### sys-Module

sys module and system programming. Like all the other modules, the sys module has to be imported with the import statement, i.e.

> import sys

The sys module provides information about constants, functions and methods of the Python interpreter. dir(system) gives a summary of the available constants, functions and methods. Another possibility is the help() function. Using help(sys) provides valuable detail information.

Lots of scripts need access to the arguments passed to the script, when the script was started. argvargv (or to be precise sys.argv) is a list, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script. The first item of this list contains the name of the script itself. The arguments follow the script name.

```python
import sys
for i in range(len(sys.argv)):
    if i == 0:
        print "Function name: %s" % sys.argv[0]
    else:
        print "%d. argument: %s" % (i,sys.argv[i])
```
### Date-Time Module
Python has a module named datetime to work with dates and times. 
There are a lot of ways we can use the date time module.
eg: To get current date,time, formatting date time etc.
Example : 
```python
datetime_object = datetime.datetime.now()
print(datetime_object)

Output:
2019-12-19 09:26:03.478039
```

### String Module

The string module provides additional tools to manipulate strings. Some methods available in the standard data tstructure are not available in the string module (e.g., isalpha).
```python
from string import Formatter

formatter = Formatter()
print(formatter.format('{website}', website='Google'))
print(formatter.format('{} {website}', 'Welcome to', website='Google'))

# format() behaves in similar manner
print('{} {website}'.format('Welcome to', website='Google'))

Output:
Welcome to Google
Welcome to Google
```

####  User defined Modules in Python
i) Create a module

```python
#A simple module, calc.py
price=1000
def add(x, y):
return (x+y)
def sub(x, y):
return (x-y)
def mul(x, y):
return (x*y)

#Use Module
# importing module calc.py
import calc
print calc.add(10, 2)
```




# Procedural programming approach in Python:
#### Introduction
Programming paradigm is a way to categorize programming languages by their features, and procedural, object oriented, functional, logic-based are common paradigms. Among those paradigms, there is always debates or curiosity of which is better than what2. Although you may not noticed, Python is very flexible on a programming style - you can code not only in the procedural or the objective oriented but also the functional style3. Due to this flexibility, it is highly likely that you are going to face the question of “What programming paradigm should I use?”. The short answer is “you are fine to use ANY style”. However, if you don’t want to mix match with only disadvantages of each paradigm, it would be nice to know characteristics of each style.

#### Procedural
Procedural, one type of imperative language, is based on the procedure which can be any series of computational steps4. So basically, you combine these procedures to instruct a computer each step it has to take to perform a certain task. Procedures are usually modularized by a function definition which provides very simple interface to be used by others. In other words, programmers can easily combine modules from different places to create a program. However, since each function has no relationship with another, it can be placed anywhere, giving programmers a hard task to find the correct procedure (which may lead duplicated procedures all over the places). In order to solve this problem, programming languages usually provides a way to containerize related functions (and variables). In Python, each file behaves as a container (called as a module in Python) thus you can easily organize related items without difficulty.

Getting a sum of a list can be done in the procedural way as following:

```python
new_lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
def sum_list(lst):
	result = 0
	for value in lst:
		result += value
	return result
print(sum_list(new_lst))
```
